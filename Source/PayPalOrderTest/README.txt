BIG (BIG!) DISCLAIMER:

You might be inclined to believe that all of the goodness contained 
herein was mine, but you'd be wrong.  I have indeed written a bunch 
of the code, but to be clear, all of the best ideas, not to mention 
90% of the POCOs came from the PayPal folks:

	https://github.com/paypal/rest-api-sdk-dotnet

The PayPal folk made mention of including the copyright from their 
LICENSE.txt file along with any derivitave products.  Inasmuch as 
I am not a lawyer, I couldn't quite figure out how to tease the 
relevant text from the document.  Regardless, it is my intent to 
fully comply with the terms of their license, so if anyone with 
legal smarts wants to weigh in, please email louis@squideyes.com 
with any relevant info.

Hi!  It's important to understand that the SquidEyes.PayPal 
library is less than fully baked.  With that said, I'm pretty
happy with how things have turned out so far.  I plan to 
incorporate the library into a new shareware application 
within the next month of so, so keep tuned for upcoming changes.  

Before you use the PayPalOrderTest application, you need to set
the PayPalClientId and PayPalSecret values, on the Properties / 
Settings screen.  Otherwise, the library and application should 
be pretty each to understand.

If you have any questions at all, please feel free to email me. 

Enjoy....
